# TypeScript SDK for the Italian eInvoice API

The Italian eInvoice API is a RESTful API that allows you to send and receive invoices through the
Italian [Servizio di Interscambio (SDI)][1], or Interchange Service. The API is designed by Invoicetronic to be simple
and easy to use, abstracting away SDI complexity while providing complete control over the
invoice send/receive process. The API also provides advanced features as encryption at rest, invoice validation,
multiple upload formats, webhooks, event logging, client SDKs for commonly used languages, and CLI tools.
